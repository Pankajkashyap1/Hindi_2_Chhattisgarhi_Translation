Hindi to Chhattisgarhi machine translation using LSTM

"Hindi to Chhattisgarhi translation" refers to the process of converting text from the Hindi language to the Chhattisgarhi language.

The goal of Hindi to Chhattisgarhi translation is to convey the meaning of the original content accurately while taking into account linguistic and cultural nuances. This process is essential for communication between individuals or groups who speak different languages, allowing them to understand and exchange information effectively.

Chhattisgarhi language is a local area language used in Chhattisgarh state. To motive of this project to reduce the communication problem in between other to rular area persons from Chhattisgarh. 

**Creation of LSTM model**

Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) aimed at dealing with the vanishing gradient problem present in traditional RNNs.

**Structure of LSTM**

An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network is a type of RNN recurrent neural network that is capable of handling and processing sequential data. The structure of an LSTM network consists of a series of LSTM cells, each of which has a set of gates (input, output, and forget gates) that control the flow of information into and out of the cell. The gates are used to selectively forget or retain information from the previous time steps, allowing the LSTM to maintain long-term dependencies in the input data.
